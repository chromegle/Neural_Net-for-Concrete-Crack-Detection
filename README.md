# Neural_Net-for-Concrete-Crack-Detection
Building a neural network using Crack detection dataset created by SDNET2018 
This project has been done as a part of my academics this include a basic implementation of deep learning for contactless crack detection.
reference to this project is Udemy course on building self driving car and the starter bundle of Adrian Rosebrock-Deep learning for computer vision book.
